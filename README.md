## ElasticLaneNet: An Efficient Geometry-Flexible Lane Detection Framework
The work has been early accepted to WACV 2025. 

## Introduction
![ElasticLaneNet-Poster](https://github.com/yxfengl/ElasticLaneNet/blob/main/poster.pdf)

Here is the official implementation for "ElasticLaneNet: An Efficient Geometry-Flexible Lane Detection Framework" [paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2025/html/Feng_ElasticLaneNet_An_Efficient_Geometry-Flexible_Lane_Detection_Framework_WACV_2025_paper.html), [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P8EgP5IaocEgWpk0c9l2HUY28bw3txUC/view?usp=drive_link
).
The code is being sorted out and the repository will be updated gradually.

## Data Preparation
1. SDLane

The labels of SDLane are adjusted to the similar structure to CULane, which can be found in the [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LtuRg7_ogQdlCEHxgMrPn0IUE6M2FXx3?usp=drive_link). The pre-processing code of the labels is being sorted out. 

2. CULane and TuSimple

Same with many other works (will be described soon).

## Running the code
```git clone https://github.com/yxfengl/ElasticLaneNet.git```
